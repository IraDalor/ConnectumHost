To build the database, 
first you have to make sure the local databse is clear. 
Then delete all migrations (the cs files) in the migrations folder.
Example: If you wanted to build the user table, 
first insert the command in the NuGet Console 'add-migration AddUserToDb' 
and then after the build finishes you will enter 'update-database'
